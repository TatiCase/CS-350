<h1>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving</h1>
The final project, which involved building a thermostat prototype, and the milestone three Morse code project were the two that I thought I completed the best. In order to determine whether to turn on or off the heating system, which is represented by an LED, the thermostat project required developing a task scheduler that would use the temperature sensor to check the ambient temperature and compare it to a predetermined point. Furthermore, the device's two buttons could be used to raise or lower the temperature set point. Every 200 ms, the task scheduler would check to see if a button had been pressed, every 500 ms, it would check the outside temperature, and every second, it would decide whether heat was required and turn on or off the LED correspondingly. 
Two messages were shown in Morse code by the Morse code project. On a never-ending loop, the two messages, "SOS" and "OK," were shown one after the other. Toggling between messages would require you to press one of the buttons. To do this, a state machine and two LEDs were used to determine whether an LED should be on or off. A dash was represented by turning on the green LED for 1500 ms, and a dot by turning on the red LED for 500 ms. Between each character in the message and every word, there was a 1500 ms pause during which both LEDs were off. When switching messages while a message was being displayed, pressing the button would cause the current message to end before the new one could begin.

<h1>What did you do particularly well?<h1/>
I think I performed especially well at segmenting each project into manageable chunks. I was able to finish a little portion at a time because of this without getting overwhelmed. In my opinion, I also did a fantastic job of outlining the program's flow before I began writing any code. This made it easier for me to debug the code when I encountered problems and enabled me to write it in a logical order.

<h1>Where could you improve?</h1>
I did a respectable job of planning the program's functionality and flow before translating my ideas into code, but I struggled with writing the state diagram documentation. It was challenging for me to translate my thoughts into a comprehensible state diagram from what I was writing in code. With more practice, I believe I could get better at this.

<h1>What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?</h1>
I gained a great deal of knowledge about embedded systems and programming throughout the course of these projects. Before taking this class, I had no prior experience with this. I learned a lot about subjects, resources, and languages that I had never used before. I discovered that I needed to use a variety of resources to help me understand the material because there was so much new information for me to learn. The TI microcontroller documentation turned out to be a very helpful resource.

<h1>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?<h1></h1>
My ability to plan and think through a program's flow and divide it into manageable chunks has improved as a result of these projects. I will be able to utilize this extremely helpful skill in upcoming projects.

<h1>How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</h1>
I used good coding practices to make this project readable, flexible, and maintainable. I divided the code into manageable sections by using functions, commenting my code, and giving my variables descriptive names. Additionally, I employed a state machine to manage the program's flow. Because of this, expanding the program's functionality without altering the existing code was simple. For instance, adding a new message to the Morse code project would only require adding a new array with the message, which I could then easily add into the rotation.
